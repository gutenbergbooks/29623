<h1>THE<br />
<big>CUCKOO<br />
CLOCK</big></h1>

<h2><small>BY WESLEY BAREFOOT</small></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big>You know a murderer preys on your household&mdash;lives
with you&mdash;depends on you&mdash;and you have no defence!</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Death</span> wore the seeming of a
battered Chevrolet.</p>

<p>The child's scream and the
screech of rubber on concrete
knifed through two seconds of
time before snapping, like a celery
stalk of sound, into aching silence.
The silence of limbo, called into
being for the space of a slow
heartbeat. Then the thud of running
feet, the rising hubbub of
many voices.</p>

<p>"Give her air!"</p>

<p>"Keep back. Don't try to move
her."</p>

<p>"Somebody call an ambulance."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and somebody call a
cop, too."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it." It was the
driver of the ramshackle Chevvie.
"She fell off the curb right in
front of me. Honest to God, it
wasn't my fault."</p>

<p>"Got to report these things
right away," said the grey-haired
man beside him. "No cause to
worry if you ain't to blame."</p>

<p>"Probably no brakes," said a
heavily accented voice, and another
spoke as if on cue, "Probably
no insurance, neither."</p>

<p>"Let me through! Oh, please&mdash;"
The woman's voice was on the
edge of hysteria. She came through
the crowd like an automaton, not
seeing the people she shoved and
elbowed aside.</p>

<hr />

<p>"D.O.A.," said the woman
heavily. Her face was no longer
twisted with shock, and she was
almost pretty again. "D.O.A.
Dead on arrival, it means. Oh,
Jim, I never knew they said that."
Suddenly there were tears in her
blue eyes. There had been many
tears, now.</p>

<div class="figright"><small><b><i>Illustrator</i>: Ernie Barth</b></small>

<p>"Take it easy, Jean, honey."
Jim Blair hoisted his lank six feet
out of the old rocker, and crossed
the room, running a nervous hand
through his cornshuck hair. <i>She's
only thirty</i>, he thought, <i>and I'm
three years older. That's awfully
young to have bred three kids and
lost them.</i> He took her in his arms.
"I know how tough it is. It's bad
enough for me, and probably
worse for you. But at least we're
sure they'll never be bomb fodder.
And we still have Joanna."</p>

<hr />

<p>She twisted away from him, her
voice suddenly bitter. "Don't
give me that Pollyanna stuff, Jim.
'Goody, goody, only a broken leg.
It might have been your back.'
There's no use trying to whitewash
it. Our kids, our <i>own</i> kids,
all gone. Dead." She began to sob.
"I wish I were, too."</p>

<p>"Jean, Jean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care. I mean it. Everything
bad has happened since
Joanna came to live with us."</p>

<p>"Darling, you can't blame the
child for a series of accidents."</p>

<p>"I know." She raised her tear-stained
face. "But after all&mdash; Michael,
drowned. Then Steve,
falling off the water tower. Now
it's Marian." Her fingers gripped
his arm tightly. "Jim, each of
them was playing alone with
Joanna when it happened."</p>

<p>"Accidents, just accidents," he
said. It wasn't like Jean, this talk.
Almost&mdash; His mind shied away
from the word, and circled back.
Almost paranoid. But Jean was
stable, rational, always had been.
Still, maybe a little chat with
Doctor Holland would be a good
idea. Breakdowns <i>do</i> happen.</p>

<p>They both turned at the slamming
of the screen door. Then
came the patter of childish feet on
the kitchen linoleum, and Joanna
burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Mommy, I want to play with
Marian. Why can't I play with
Marian?"</p>

<p>Jean put her arm around the
girl's thin shoulder. "Darling,
you won't be able to play with
Marian for&mdash;quite a while. You
mustn't worry about it now."</p>

<p>"Mommy, she looked just like
she was asleep, then they came and
took her away." Her lips trembled.
"I'm frightened, Mommy."</p>

<hr />

<p>Jim looked down at the dark
eyes, misted now, the straight
brown hair, and the little snub
nose with its dusting of freckles.
<i>She's all we have left, poor kid, and
not even ours, really. Helen's baby.</i></p>

<p>He looked up as the battered
cuckoo clock on the mantel clicked
warningly. "Time for little girls
to be in bed, Joanna. Run along
now like a good girl, and get
washed." Even as he spoke the
miniature doors flew open and the
caricature of a bird popped out,
shrilly announcing the hour. It
cuckooed eight times, then bounced
back inside. Joanna watched entranced.</p>

<p>"Bed time, darling," said Jean
gently. "School tomorrow, remember?
And don't forget to
brush your teeth."</p>

<p>"I won't. Goodnight, Mommy,
goodnight, Daddy." She turned up
her face to be kissed, smiled at
them, and was gone. They listened
to her footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Jim, I'm sorry about the
things I said." Jean's voice was
hesitant, a little ashamed. "It <i>is</i>
hard, though, you know it is&mdash; Jim,
aren't you listening? After
all, you don't have to watch the
clock now." Her smile was as
labored as the joke.</p>

<p>He smiled back. "I think I'll
take a walk, honey. Some fresh
air would do me good."</p>

<p>"Jim, don't go. I'd rather not
be alone just now."</p>

<p>"Well." He looked at her, keeping
his expression blank. "All
right, dear. How about some coffee?
I could stand another cup."
And he thought: <i>Tomorrow I'll go.
I'll talk to Holland tomorrow.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>"Let me get this straight, Jim."
Holland's pudgy face was sober,
his eyes serious. "You started out
by thinking Jean was showing
paranoid tendencies, and offhand
I'm inclined to agree with you.
Overnight you changed your mind
and began thinking that maybe,
just maybe, she might be right.
Honestly, don't you suspect your
own reasons for such a quick
switch?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do, Bob," Blair said
worriedly. "Do you think I
haven't beaten out my brains
over it? I know the idea's monstrous.
But just suppose there <i>was</i>
a branch of humanity&mdash;if you
could call it human&mdash;living off us
unsuspected. A branch that knows
how to eliminate&mdash;competition&mdash;almost
by instinct."</p>

<p>"Now hold on a minute, Jim.
You've taken Jean's reaction to
this last death, plus a random association
with a cuckoo clock, and
here you are with a perfectly wild
hypothesis. You've always been
rational and analytical, old man.
Surely you can realize that a perfectly
normal urge to rationalize
Jean's conclusions is making you
concur with them against your
better judgment."</p>

<p>"Bob&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not through, Jim. Just
consider how fantastic the whole
idea is. Because of a series of accidents
you can't accuse a child of
planned murder. Nor can you further
hypothesize that all orphans
are changelings, imbued with an
instinct to polish off their foster-siblings."</p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i> orphans, Bob. Not
planned murder, either. Take it
easy. Just some of them. A few of
them&mdash;different. Growing up.
Placing their young with well-to-do
families somehow, and then
dropping unobtrusively out of the
picture. And the young growing
up, and always the natural children
dying off in one way or another.
The changeling inherits,
and the process is repeated, step
by step. Can you say it's impossible?
Do you <i>know</i> it's impossible?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say impossible,
Jim. But I <i>would</i> say that your
thesis has a remarkably low index
of probability. Why don't others
suspect, besides you?"</p>

<p>Jim spread his hands hopelessly.
"I don't know. Maybe
they do. Maybe these creatures&mdash;if
they do exist&mdash;have some
means of protection we don't
know about."</p>

<p>"You need more than maybes,
Jim. What about Joanna Simmons'
mother? According to your
theories she should have been
well off. Was she?"</p>

<p>"No, she wasn't," Jim admitted
reluctantly. "She came here and
took a job with my outfit. Said
she was divorced, and had lived
in New York. Then she quit to
take a position in California, and
we agreed to board Joanna until
she got settled. Warrenburg was
the town. She was killed there
quite horribly, in a terrible auto
accident."</p>

<p>"Have you any reason for suspecting
skulduggery? Honestly,
Jim? Or for labelling her one of
your human&mdash;er&mdash;cuckoos?"</p>

<p>"Only my hunch. We had a
newspaper clipping, and a letter
from the coroner. We even sent
the money for her funeral. But
those things could be faked, Bob."</p>

<p>"Give me some evidence that
they <i>were</i> faked, and I'll be happy
to reinspect your views." Holland
levered his avoirdupois out of his
chair. "In the meantime, relax.
Take a trip if you can. Try not to
worry."</p>

<p>Jim grinned humorlessly.
"Mustn't let myself get excited,
eh? Okay, Bob. But if I get hold
of any evidence that I think you
might accept, I'll be back. The
last laugh and all that. Pending
developments you take it easy,
too. Don't let yourself get overworked.
Stay out of the sun. So
long now."</p>

<p>"So long, Jim."</p>

<hr />

<p>It was cool in the Warrenburg
city hall, though outside the
streets were sizzling.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Mr. Blair," said the
stout, motherly woman with the
horn-rimmed glasses. "We've no
record of a Helen Simmons. Nothing
whatever." She closed the file
with resolute finality.</p>

<p>Jim stared at her. "Are you
sure? There must be something.
Mightn't there be a special file for
accident cases? She was here in
Warrenburg. She died here."</p>

<p>The woman thinned her lips,
shook her head. "If we had any
information, it'd be right where
I looked. There isn't a thing.
Have you tried her last address?
Maybe they could tell you something.
We can't."</p>

<p>"I'll try that next. Thanks a
lot."</p>

<p>"Sorry we couldn't help you."</p>

<p>He went out slowly.</p>

<hr />

<p>872 Maple was a rambling
frame house dozing on a wide
flower-bordered lot. There was
nothing sleepy about the diminutive
woman who opened the door
to Jim's knock. Snapping black
eyes peered at him from a maze of
wrinkles. A veined hand moved
swiftly to smooth down the white
hair that framed her face.</p>

<p>"Looking for someone, young
man?"</p>

<p>"Just information, Mrs.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Collins, and it's Miss. Don't
give out information about guests.
You a bill collector?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Collins. As a matter
of fact, I'm trying to check up on
an old friend I lost track of. Helen
Simmons. She lived at this address
for a while."</p>

<p>"Sure did. Well, come on in.
Mind you, I don't usually do this,
Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blair." Without any fanfare a
bill changed hands.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blair. Well, I can't tell
you much. Try that green chair
for size. What do you want to
know?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Jim studied the toe of his right
shoe. His eyes were veiled. "I
heard she was hurt, and hard up,
and I was worried. My wife and I
were friends of hers back east."</p>

<p>"Hurt, hard up? Humph! Not
likely, spendin' all her time drivin'
that English car around. Takin'
trips. I'm not sayin' she didn't
mind her manners, though."</p>

<p>"Did she have any close
friends?"</p>

<p>"She was chummy with Edith
Walton, the girl that works for
Doc Mendel. He's county coroner
in his spare time. No men. Didn't
fool around at all. I'd a known."</p>

<hr />

<p>Behind Jim's stony eyes the
pattern took clearer form, as if a
mosaic approached completion. A
mosaic of carefully planned events
that totalled horror. He shivered
as the outlines of his hunch filled
in. Helen&mdash;what creatures were
these? Helen&mdash;not dead, not
poor,&mdash;carefully planting ostensible
proof of her death and going
on to a new role, a new life, in
London or Paris or Rome. A free,
untrammelled life. And her child&mdash;if
child was the word&mdash;in his
home, repeating the pattern.
Eliminating competition as her
mother undoubtedly had done.
The competition&mdash;his and Jean's
children! Changeling, changeling&mdash; No,
not that. Incubus! He
shivered again.</p>

<p>"Rabbits on your grave, Mr.
Blair?"</p>

<p>He looked up slowly. "Sorry. I
was just wondering. Did Miss
Simmons have a job while she was
here?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't. One thing she
did do was rent a place. Used to
be Blands Hardware. Paid a
month's rent, too. Said some
friends of hers were plannin' to
open a mortuary. Seemed like a
funny way for people to do business,
but then, no affair of mine."</p>

<p>Funny? No, not funny at all,
but icily, eerily logical. There had
to be an undertaking parlor where
he could send the funeral expenses.
He wondered if Helen had
laughed when she opened the letter.
Everyone his, or her, own
undertaker. And the carefully
cultivated friend in the coroner's
office. For stationery.</p>

<p>He got to his feet. "Thanks a
lot, Miss Collins. You've been a
great deal of help." He almost
smiled as he asked, "I don't suppose
she left a forwarding address?"</p>

<p>The old head shook decisively.
"Not a thing. Just packed and
left, one Monday morning."</p>

<p>All the loose ends tied up tight
on a Monday morning. Nothing
to cause suspicion. Nothing to
worry about. Only a woman's almost
paranoid hysteria,&mdash;and a
glance at a clock. Not very much
to unmask&mdash;incubus. And what
could he do? What <i>could</i> he do?
Start talking and land in an institution?
Well, there was one thing.</p>

<p>"Thanks again, Miss Collins."</p>

<p>He went out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Swanson didn't look like the
general conception of a small-town
newspaperman. One knew instinctively
that his beard wouldn't
have been tobacco-stained even if
he'd cared to grow one. And he
didn't have a bottle of bourbon in
the file marked Miscellaneous, or
if he did he didn't bring it out.</p>

<p>"That never came from my
paper," he said precisely. He
handed the clipping back to Jim.
"We don't use that type, for one
thing. For another, Miss Simmons,
so far as I know, wasn't
killed here or anywhere else."</p>

<p>"You knew her?"</p>

<p>"I knew of her. I never met
her."</p>

<p>"What about this report of her
death?"</p>

<p>Swanson shrugged; tented manicured
fingers. "It's a hoax. Any
job printing shop with a Linotype
could do it. In all likelihood it was
some place in San Francisco.
That's closest. It would be very
difficult to check." His curiosity
was showing.</p>

<p>"I see. Well, thanks for your
time and trouble, Mr. Swanson."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Sorry I couldn't be
of more help."</p>

<p>One thing to do. One thing that
must be done.</p>

<p>Motors over the mountains.
And riding with them, the numb
resolve. Motors over the salt pans,
the wheat lands, the corn belt.</p>

<p>The stewardess stops again.
"Coffee, sir? A sandwich, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"I beg your&mdash; Oh, no. No,
thanks."</p>

<p>She watches him covertly, uneasily,
longing for the end of the
run.</p>

<p>Motors in the night.</p>

<p>And the dull determination
growing, strengthening.</p>

<p>The airport, baggage, the ancient
taxi with the piston slap,
and at last the dark, familiar
street.</p>

<p>"Jim, you're back! Oh, Jim,
darling. Next time they send you
west I'm going too. I am!"</p>

<p>"Okay, Jean, sure. Why not?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter, dear? Oh,
you're tired, of course. I should
have known. Sit down, Jim. Let
me get you a drink."</p>

<p>"In a minute, Jean." Do it
now <i>now</i> NOW! "Where's Joanna?"</p>

<p>"She's in bed. Hours ago. Jim,
has something&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. I just want to
look in on her. And freshen up a
bit, of course."</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smoothed away the worried
frown with his forefinger.</p>

<p>"In a minute, dear."</p>

<p>She smiled uncertainly. "Hurry
back, Jim."</p>

<hr />

<p>The stairs unwind irrevocably,
slow motion in a nightmare. The
bedroom door opens, the hall light
dim on the bed and the child's
face. Incubus in the half dark.</p>

<p>For a moment Jim remembered
wondering somewhere, sometime,
what strange powers of protection
might be implicit in such a creature.
As the thought came into his
mind, Joanna stirred. She opened
her eyes and looked at him.</p>

<p>He took one step toward the
bed.</p>

<p>The little girl eyes over their
dusting of freckles slitted. Then
they opened wide, became two
glowing golden lakes that grew,
and grew&mdash;</p>

<p>There was the feeling of a great
soundless explosion in his mind.
Waves of cool burning in his
brain, churning and bubbling in
every unknown corner, every
cranny. Here and there a cell, or
a group of cells, blanked out, the
complex molecules reverting, becoming
new again. Ready for fresh
punch marks. Synapses shorted
with soundless cold fire, and
waited in timeless stasis for rechannelling.
The waves frothed,
became ripples, were gone. He
stood unmoving.</p>

<p>What was it he was supposed
to do? Let's see&mdash; Tuck Joanna's
blanket around her. But she was
covered up snugly. Sleeping soundly,
too, and for a few seconds he'd
thought she was awake. And Jean
was waiting downstairs, Jean and
a cool drink.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, stop in the bathroom.</p>

<p>The stairs wind up again. It is
good to be with one's family, relaxed
in the well known chair. Not
a worry in the world.</p>

<p>He sat there, his mind at ease,
not caring much about anything.
He didn't even look up when the
clock on the mantel whirred, and
the ridiculous bird popped out of
its nest to herald a new day.</p>
